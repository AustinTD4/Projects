## Evolutionary Algorithm Framework for Evoman and IRobobo
This framework develops neural network parameters through various evolutionary strategies and the experiments within showcase the application of evolutionary algorithms in real-time environments. These Algorithms were used to develop a computer player for the game Evoman, based on Megaman. They eres also used to develop a controller agent for a hardware Robot, it completed real world tasks such as gathering food and transporting objects to an objective.

- **Application**: Adaptable for any environment mapping Neural Network outputs to predictions or maximization
- **Key Features**: Multiple evolutionary strategies, experimentation with neural network parameters
